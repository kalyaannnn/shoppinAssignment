## Query Response Analysis

### Test Case 1: Basic Search + Price Constraint
**Query**: "I'm looking for a floral skirt in size S under $40. Can you check if it's in stock and if I can use the discount code 'SAVE10'?"

| Agent | Response Analysis | Hallucination Check |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| ReAct | ✓ Found correct product (Floral Skirt $35)  ✓ Verified size S availability  ✓ Checked discount code | ❌ Incorrectly claimed SAVE10 code was valid |
| ReAcT + Self Critique | ✓ Found correct product  ✓ Verified stock status  ✗ Generic discount mention | ❌ Did not verify specific discount code  ❌ Made assumptions about Store A |

### Test Case 2: Shipping Deadline Query
**Query**: "I need white sneakers in size 8 under $70 that can be delivered by Friday."

| Agent | Response Analysis | Hallucination Check |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| ReAct | ✗ Failed to list specific products  ✗ Generic response despite data availability | ❌ Major hallucination:  - Mentioned non-existent options  - Generic store references (X, Y, Z) |
| ReAcT + Self Critique | ✗ Generic response  ✗ Failed to use available product data | ❌ Hallucinated:  - Product details  - Store names  - Delivery times |

### Test Case 3: Price Comparison
**Query**: "I found the Casual Denim Jacket for $80. Can you check if other sites have better prices?"

| Agent | Response Analysis | Hallucination Check |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| ReAct | ✓ Found correct product  ✓ Accurate price comparison | ❌ Hallucinated:  - Non-existent discounts  - Incorrect shipping times |
| ReAcT + Self Critique | ✓ Found price variations  ✗ Inconsistent with database prices | ❌ Fabricated:  - $65 price point  - Non-existent $5 discount |

### Test Case 4: Return Policy
**Query**: "I'm interested in the red Cocktail Dress from SiteB. Can you check their return policy?"

| Agent | Response Analysis | Hallucination Check |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| ReAct | ✓ Correct store lookup  ✓ Accurate return window | ✓ No major hallucinations |
| ReAcT + Self Critique | ✗ Inconsistent policy details  ✗ Contradicted database | ❌ Hallucinated:  - Free returns (when actually paid)  - Wrong return window |

### Test Case 5: Complex Multi-Tool
**Query**: "Summer Floral Dress ($75) in size S - verify stock, discounts, prices, shipping, returns"

| Agent | Response Analysis | Hallucination Check |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| ReAct | ✓ Comprehensive check  ✓ Multiple tool usage | ❌ Minor hallucinations in discount codes |
| ReAcT + Self Critique | ✓ Structured response  ✗ Incomplete information | ❌ Hallucinated:  - Store references  - FLORAL10 code |

### Common Hallucination Patterns

1. **Discount Codes**
   - Both agents frequently hallucinated non-existent discount codes
   - ReAcT + Self Critique agent showed more tendency to create fictional discounts

2. **Store References**
   - ReAct used generic store names (X, Y, Z)
   - ReAcT + Self Critique created fictional store names not in database

3. **Price Modifications**
   - Both agents sometimes quoted prices not in database
   - ReAcT + Self Critique showed more price hallucinations

4. **Delivery Times**
   - ReAct stayed closer to database values
   - ReAcT + Self Critique often fabricated delivery estimates


## Future Exploration: CRAFT as an Adaptive Tool Creation and Reasoning System

### **CRAFT: A Vision for Next-Generation Agentic Systems**
CRAFT, as outlined in this research paper, provides a framework for dynamic tool creation and retrieval, overcoming the limitations of static tool usage in existing approaches like ReAct, ReST, and Hybrid Structured ReAct. Instead of relying on a predefined set of APIs, CRAFT allows the LLM to generate and validate custom tools to handle novel tasks more effectively (Li et al., 2024).

---

### Key Innovations of CRAFT

1. **Automated Tool Creation**:  
   - Instead of relying on pre-built tools, CRAFT generates new Python functions based on the task at hand.  
   - Example: For a novel task requiring data aggregation, CRAFT can dynamically create a function tailored to the specific dataset and query structure.

2. **Tool Validation & Abstraction**:  
   - Created tools are automatically verified and abstracted for reuse, ensuring correctness and generalizability (Wang et al., 2024).  
   - Tools are stored in a repository with metadata for efficient retrieval.

3. **Multi-View Tool Retrieval**:  
   - Rather than simple keyword matching, CRAFT retrieves tools based on problem context, function names, and descriptions to maximize relevance.  
   - This ensures that tools are selected based on semantic understanding rather than syntactic similarity.

4. **Scalable Generalization**:  
   - By leveraging tool-based adaptation, CRAFT allows LLMs to efficiently extend capabilities to new domains without requiring full retraining (Zhou et al., 2024).

### How CRAFT Solves Pitfalls of Existing Approaches in a Virtual Shopping Assistant

#### 1. **Dynamic Tool Creation to Overcome Predefined API Limitations**
- **Problem**: ReAct, ReST, and Hybrid rely on predefined APIs, limiting adaptability to new platforms or features.  
- **Solution**: CRAFT dynamically creates tools for emerging platforms (e.g., Etsy, Depop) or niche queries (e.g., sustainable fashion brands).

#### 2. **Secure Execution to Mitigate Risks of Arbitrary Code Generation**
- **Problem**: Existing approaches lack mechanisms for secure execution of external tools.  
- **Solution**: CRAFT uses sandboxed environments (e.g., Docker) and static analysis tools to ensure safe code execution.

#### 3. **Scalable Generalization to Handle Diverse Platforms and Queries**
- **Problem**: Scalability is limited by API availability and speed in ReAct and Hybrid.  
- **Solution**: CRAFT leverages multi-view tool retrieval and hierarchical categorization to scale effectively across platforms.

#### 4. **Error Handling and Validation to Reduce Hallucination and Inconsistencies**
- **Problem**: Existing approaches struggle with unreliable API responses or conflicting information.  
- **Solution**: CRAFT integrates automated validation and multi-source verification to ensure accuracy.

#### 5. **Adaptability to Evolving User Preferences and E-Commerce Trends**
- **Problem**: Existing approaches lack mechanisms for adapting to changing user preferences or trends.  
- **Solution**: CRAFT adapts by generating tools aligned with emerging trends (e.g., sustainability filters) and refining processes based on user feedback.
